## WHAT or WHO IS ROVER?

Rover is a simple Desktop Assistant created in C# programming language with Net Framework 4.0. 
This program can create GDI objects, draw icons on the screen, thanks to TTS (Text To Speech) it can speak, but it can also destroy the system.
Like most Desktop Assistants, it also has a lot of animations.

## HOW TO USE IT?

As this is a program that contains dangerous code, I recommend testing it on a Virtual Machine or on an unused device. 
Do not under any circumstances run this program on physical hardware, it could cause unwanted damage! 
I am not responsible for any damages!

If you want to run Rover, don't forget to install Net Framework 4.0. You can have a newer version, but it can't be older. 
Most Windows already have the Net Framework built in, but for example, Windows XP does not.

The package has no installer in it. Just turn on the program and everything works.
